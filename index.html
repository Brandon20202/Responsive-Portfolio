            <p>I am 28 years old and I currently live in Austin. I am originally from Fort worth. I enjoy long walks on the beach while I jam me some Kid cudi. I love music, it is my second passion behind computers. I can trouble shoot a PC and Mac. I have a 9 year old daughter. She is my world and joy. She loves everything that is bright and cute. I wish she enjoyed sports as much as I do but its still time to get her into them. </p>
            <p2>I enjoy playing video games. The gaming console I have is a Xbox one. On it, I have Grand theft Auto 5, Remake of Resident Evil 2, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Crash Bandacot.</p2>
            <p3>I love to travel all of the world. I have been to Germany and USA countries. States I have been to are Louisiana, Arkansas, Florida, and Texas. I traveled by car in the US and by flight to Orlando/Germany.</p3>
